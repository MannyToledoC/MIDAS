# MIDAS
With this project we set up to design a budgeting application that would be straightforward to use. We planned that such design would appeal to the casual mobile and web user to aid them manage their finances in an intuitive manner. Another goal was to allow the user to be highly aware of their balance from their different bank accounts and the balance of their credit cards, so we decided to display that information at the top of the homepage. And while our design was very tempting for beginners in financial budgeting, we included stocks to attract folks more experienced with finances and encourage beginners to start their investing journey. The Scope of this Project will include the formalization of the design of up to 10 use cases of our system. It will not include the implementation of such use cases and it will include the function definition of the other use cases apart from the 10 chosen.
